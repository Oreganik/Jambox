# Setting up a Unity project with Jambox

Jambox is typically installed to this directory:
{UNITY_PROJECT}/Assets/Jambox

In the {UNITY_PROJECT}/Assets/Jambox/_Setup directory, you'll find three folders. Here's what to do with them.

## ProjectDirectoryStructureExample
A quick template for storing assets properly.
* Duplicate this
* Move it to Assets
* Rename it to "Prototype" (or whatever you like)

## ResourcesExample
Jambox provides a super fast way to add sounds to your project by utilizing the Resources folder to load them at runtime, and then letting you access them by the filename. (There's also some more-or-less implemented high score code files in there we don't need to worry about. :D )
* Duplicate this
* Move it to Assets
* Rename it "Resources"

## ScriptTemplatesExample
Script templates save time when building prototypes.
* Duplicate this
* Move it to Assets
* Rename it "ScriptTemplates"
* Restart Unity to load them
